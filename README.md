# hassio-blueprints

This is a collectiopn blueprints that I have created for my own Home Assistant installations. My ambition is to share them - and keep sharing them - and do so with constant variable names so they can be updated without breaking. However, I do not guarantee that I won't change anything or that I won't do any mistakes. The [LICENSE](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/westlund/hassio-blueprints/refs/heads/main/LICENSE) file applies to everything in this repository.
